The Bridgerpay Woocommerce plugin enables you to easily accept payments through your Woocommerce store.

== Description ==

[BridgerPay](https://www.bridgerpay.com) is the world‚Äôs first payment operations platform, built to automate ALL payment flows with a Lego-like interface, empowering ANY business to scale their payments, insights, and revenue with a codeless, unified and agnostic software, designed to process more.

= What this module does for your WooCommerce store = 
BridgerPay is the only payments plugin you will ever need for your WooCommerce store.

You will be able to delete all your individual plugins and customizations for connecting multiple payment providers and optimize your checkout. BridgerPay gives you access to 500+ ready-made and codeless connections to any payment provider you need to reach your customers anywhere.

BridgerPay‚Äôs checkout is dynamic, meaning that you can build specific payment flows according to location, currency, and dozens of other filters and combinations with our Lego-like interface, and only show the payment methods that best suit each customer.

BridgerPay‚Äôs powerful reporting engine gives you real-time, unprecedented insights into your transactions, so you can make faster, data-driven decisions to boost conversions and slash processing fees.

BridgerPay‚Äôs Checkout is PCI DSS Level 1 and is ready to make you scale faster.

In a nutshell, BridgerPay unifies and automates all your payment operations, end-to-end and in a drag-and-drop interface. 

Here is a word from Yehoshua Fried, CTO at Calypsa: ‚ÄúWe were using just two payment solutions and customers were complaining about the lack of options. BridgerPay had all the payment connections we wanted and the ability to support any payment method we'll need in the future. You integrate with BridgerPay once and you can connect hundreds of processors without wasting time on development. A year ago, if we wanted to change our Credit Card provider it would cost us $20k to integrate, now we can do it in seconds using BridgerPay's Connections.‚Äù
